## 🚀 Project Vision

Local leagues usually suffer from poor visibility, manual coordination, and zero fan engagement. HPL fixes that.

**Goals:**

* Digitize league operations
* Improve visibility for teams and players
* Provide real-time updates and schedules
* Build an audience-first league experience

Think of it as *"IPL-style experience for local cricket."*
